# DAT505 Advanced Creative Coding

## Getting Started
This is a README file which will act as a guide for this project. It will give you a step by step overview of how to use it on your own personal device.

## Development of my project
My idea for this module was to create an audio visual composition that the user could also interact with. My main design idea was Space which would include Planets and stars.

To start with I had to create the planets I would have wanted to use for the project. I decided to use the program Maya. I had a play around with the different shapes and then changing the sizes and colours of the shapes. I then decided to add different features to the planets such as the rings going around two of the planets.

This image below shows the planets with the materials. I decided to go with different colours and designs so that they don't all look the same. I then had to decide which of the planets I had made would go into the final project.

This image shows the project in its final stages. Both the planet in the centre of the screen and the stars in the background rotate so it looks like outer space. I also inputted an audio into the project which is a slow relaxing track. For the audio to begin the user will need to click on the page.

This image shows the click event that I added to the project. When the user clicks on the page then the planet in the centre of the page will disappear. If the user clicks again then a different planet will appear which is shown in the image below.

This image is what happens when the user clicks on the page when there is no planet in the centre of the page and a different one should be shown.

## Guide
When the project is first shown to you, you will see the planet and the background rotating. If you wish for the audio to begin you will need to left click, then from this the audio should start about 5-10 seconds after the click. Then if you click again then a different planet will be shown than the first one that was shown when the page loaded.
